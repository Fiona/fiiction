# Fiiction (By Fiona Burrows)

A Python based engine/framework for creating text based adventure games.

The goal is to emphasize simplicity over complexity, with the option of leveraging the full power of Python if necessary.

## History

Fiiction was what I used to learn Python and so became stagnent when I decided to move on to other things. As a result it's a bit messy around the edges - but I've decided I like where it was going. So I've moved it to GitHub and 
I'm going to try and continue with it.
